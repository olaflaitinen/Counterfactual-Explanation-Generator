# Counterfactual-Explanation-Generator
This project demonstrates how to generate counterfactual explanations for individual predictions using the [Alibi](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) library. We train a logistic regression classifier on the Iris dataset and then show how modifying input features can change the model's prediction.
