# Counterfactual Explanation Generator

This project demonstrates how to generate counterfactual explanations for individual predictions using the [Alibi](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) library. We train a logistic regression classifier on the Iris dataset and then show how modifying input features can change the model's prediction. The repository is structured following industry best practices, including comprehensive documentation, unit tests, and continuous integration via GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.
- **Model Training:** Train a logistic regression classifier.
- **Counterfactual Explanations:** Use Alibi to generate counterfactual explanations for individual predictions.
- **Visualization:** Optionally visualize the generated counterfactual examples.
- **Testing:** Unit tests using pytest to ensure code quality.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.
- **Documentation:** Detailed installation and usage guides.
